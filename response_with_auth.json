		<h1>Authentication Required</h1>

		<p>Looks like you're having trouble authenticating.  Keep in mind:</p>

		<p>All requests to the MySportsFeeds API require an API Key, which you'll specify as the username.  You can manage your keys from your account page at <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com">https://www.mysportsfeeds.com</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Since this is a v2.x feed request, you'll need to specify "MYSPORTSFEEDS" as the password.</p>
